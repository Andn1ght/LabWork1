# LabWork1
Laboratory work for assignment 1 in AITU. 10 Problems about recursion. The program allows users to choose from a menu of different algorithms to solve a specific problem. Users enter a number to choose which algorithm they want to use. The program then prompts the user to enter any necessary input for the chosen algorithm.
Finally, the program outputs the result of the chosen algorithm.
